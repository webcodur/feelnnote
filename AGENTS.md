## Source of Truth
- Use `CLAUDE.md` in this repository root as the single source of project instructions.
- Do not duplicate or restate CLAUDE rules in this file.

## Codex Rule
- For this repository, read and follow `CLAUDE.md` first for project workflow, conventions, and constraints.
- If additional Codex-specific notes are ever needed, keep them minimal and ensure they do not conflict with `CLAUDE.md`.
